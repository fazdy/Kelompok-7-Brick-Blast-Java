# Brick Blast Java

## Update: Java Runtime Upgrade

This project has been updated to use the **Java 21 LTS (Long Term Support)** runtime.

### Why Java 21?
Java 21 is a significant release that provides:
- **Long Term Support:** Ensures stability and security updates for years to come.
- **Performance Improvements:** Faster startup times and lower memory footprint.
- **New Features:** Access to modern Java features such as Virtual Threads (Project Loom), Pattern Matching for switch, and Record Patterns.

### Installation Details
The Java 21 JDK has been installed to the local environment. This ensures the application runs on the latest stable platform.

### Project Status
Currently, this is a standard Java project. To fully leverage modern Java development practices, it is recommended to convert this project to use a build tool like **Maven** or **Gradle**. This would facilitate easier dependency management and automated builds.
